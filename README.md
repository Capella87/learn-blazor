# Learn-blazor

This repository is separated from [learn-aspnet](https://github.com/Capella87/learn-aspnet)
 to contain practices in [Open Source Academy 2024](https://www.contribution.ac/ossca)
 activity hosted by [National IT Industry Promotion Agency](https://www.nipa.kr) (NIPA) of Korea.

This is also a scratchpad for ASP.NET Core Blazor learning, but wholly dedicated for the activity.
Any further practices, which are also utilizing ASP.NET Core Blazor, but not affiliated
with it are uploaded in learn-aspnet repository.

## Development Environment

* .NET 8 (Mainly), and .NET 6 (Some projects)
* ASP.NET Core Blazor
* Libman

## Installation

You should use Libman to manage and make use of the latest Bootstrap library.
It can also make the repository clean because we don't have to include Bootstrap CSS files in commits.

## Projects

### .NET 8

* BlazorPractice
* BlazorToDo

### .NET 6
